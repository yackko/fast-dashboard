# fast-dashboard - A Go script designed to bootstrap dashboard applications which feature a Graphical User Interface (GUI) built using the Fyne toolkit

A Go script designed to bootstrap dashboard applications which feature a Graphical User Interface (GUI) built using the Fyne toolkit. Its key feature is the ability to generate a foundational project structure where the initial dashboard tabs, part of this Fyne-generated GUI, can be dynamically named by the developer during setup.


## Overview

This application provides a simple tabbed interface to help organize information. The initial tabs and their basic functionality (adding and listing items) are generated by the setup script.

## Prerequisites

Before you can build and run this application, you'll need:

1.  **Go:** Ensure you have Go installed (version 1.18 or later is recommended). You can download it from [golang.org/dl/](https://golang.org/dl/).
2.  **C Compiler (GCC or Clang):** Fyne has dependencies that require a C compiler.
    * **Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):**
        ```bash
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install gcc libgl1-mesa-dev xorg-dev
        ```
    * **Linux (Fedora):**
        ```bash
        sudo dnf install gcc libX11-devel libXcursor-devel libXrandr-devel libXinerama-devel mesa-libGL-devel libXi-devel libXxf86vm-devel
        ```
    * **macOS:**
        Install Xcode Command Line Tools:
        ```bash
        xcode-select --install
        ```
    * **Windows:**
        You'll need a GCC compiler, such as one provided by TDM-GCC or MinGW-w64. Follow the Fyne [Windows prerequisite guide](https://developer.fyne.io/started/prerequisites-windows).

For detailed and up-to-date Fyne prerequisites, please refer to the [official Fyne documentation](https://developer.fyne.io/started/#prerequisites).

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the application running:

1.  **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
    Open your terminal and change to the root directory of this project (e.g., `cd your_project_name`).

2.  **Initialize Go Modules:**
    If you haven't already, initialize Go modules. The setup script should have prompted you with the module name (e.g., `your_project_name` or `github.com/yourusername/your_project_name`).
    ```bash
    go mod init <module_name>
    ```
    Replace `<module_name>` with the actual module name you chose or were instructed to use.

3.  **Tidy Dependencies:**
    This command will download Fyne and any other necessary dependencies defined in the Go files.
    ```bash
    go mod tidy
    ```

4.  **Run the Application:**
    You can run the application directly using:
    ```bash
    go run ./cmd/<module_name>/main.go
    ```
    Replace `<module_name>` with the directory name inside `cmd/` (which should match your project/module name).

5.  **Build the Application (Optional):**
    To create a standalone executable:
    ```bash
    go build -o <executable_name> ./cmd/<module_name>/main.go
    ```
    Replace `<executable_name>` with your desired output file name (e.g., `dashboard`) and `<module_name>` as above.
    Then, you can run the compiled application:
    * Linux/macOS: `./<executable_name>`
    * Windows: `.\<executable_name>.exe`

## Project Structure

The project follows a standard Go project layout:

* `cmd/<module_name>/main.go`: The main entry point for the application.
* `internal/ui/`: Contains the Go files responsible for creating the UI for each tab.
    * `ideas.go` (example, if "Ideas" was a chosen tab): UI logic for the Ideas tab.
    * `todos.go` (example, if "To-Do" was a chosen tab): UI logic for the To-Do tab.
    * *(other tab files as generated)*
* `go.mod` & `go.sum`: Manage project dependencies.
* `.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.
* `README.md`: This file.

## Development

This project serves as a starting point. Here are some areas for further development:

* **Data Persistence:** Currently, any data entered (ideas, tasks, etc.) is stored in memory and will be lost when the application closes. Implement saving and loading data to/from files (e.g., JSON, CSV, SQLite) or a database.
* **Edit/Delete Functionality:** Add capabilities to edit or remove items from the lists within each tab.
* **Advanced Widgets:** Replace simple `widget.Label` list items with more complex widgets like `widget.Check` for to-do items, or `widget.Card` for richer content display.
* **Custom Item Structs:** Instead of storing items as simple strings, define Go structs for more complex data (e.g., a `TodoItem` with fields like `Text`, `DueDate`, `Priority`, `Completed`).
* **New Tabs/Features:** Add more tabs or features relevant to your dashboard's purpose.
* **Error Handling:** Implement more robust error handling throughout the application.
* **Testing:** Write unit and integration tests for your UI logic and data handling.
* **Styling and Theming:** Explore Fyne's theming capabilities to customize the application's appearance.
